10. Dynamic Programming (DP)
Objective: Build an understanding of DP for optimizing recursive solutions.
Topics:
Memoization and tabulation approaches
Common DP problems (knapsack, longest common subsequence, matrix chain multiplication)
Practice Problems:
"Climbing Stairs" (LeetCode), "Longest Increasing Subsequence" (LeetCode)
Resources:

11. Practice and Problem-Solving
Objective: Enhance coding skills through consistent practice.
Daily Problem Solving:
LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, or CodeChef
Mock Interviews:
Sites like InterviewBit and Pramp offer mock interview practice.
Competitive Programming:
Join competitions (Codeforces, AtCoder) to improve speed and problem-solving efficiency.
Tips for Success
Consistency: Solve problems regularly, gradually increasing difficulty.
Pattern Recognition: Group problems by type (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer, divide and conquer).
Review and Revise: Keep notes on problem-solving patterns and review frequently asked problems.
This roadmap will not only prepare you for interviews but also solidify your DSA knowledge for real-world software development tasks. Let me know if you’d like resources for any specific topic.
